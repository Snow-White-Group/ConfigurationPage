[![N|Solid](https://freemoser.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/146a203f-a4e5-477d-bb18-74c0183d3a0d/7/badge)](http://snowwhite-configurationpage.azurewebsites.net/)

Snow White is a software stack which enables you to build your own smartmirror by providing all necessary software and a nice user interface for the mirror.
The user interacts with the mirror by using his voice only. Snow White will be able to differentiate between multiple user and provide each user his own personal space. As a result the mirror can be used by more than one person but only one person at time. 


## Configuration Page

The Configuration Page is a global place where the user can configurate his mirror profile and sync it with multiple mirrors.
